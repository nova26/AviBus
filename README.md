# AviBus
Almost every morning i am taking the bus to work.
To schedule my morning better i am using some native app that report me with the bus expected arriavl time.
The app performence is pretty bad resulting alot of waiting at the bus station or even missing my bug.


This is a navie implementaion of a prediction system based on months of data recording.

The code include example of how to use the government formal API for real time Information.
The ICD can be located on the below link

Basically i recorded data such as location and date to sqlite db over several months,
And with the help of data mining techniques,WEKA and ANN i am trying to predict the bus arrival time
Giving his location and time.

this project is still ongoing.
